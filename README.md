1. User Management – Investors can register their accounts and create portfolios to manage their financial assets.
2. Portfolio Creation – Each user can have multiple portfolios, grouping different investments based on strategy or risk level.
3. Investment Tracking – Stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other financial assets are stored with detailed information.
4. Transaction Logging – Users can record buy/sell transactions for investments, tracking quantity and price.
5. Market Data Storage – Historical price data is saved to analyze investment trends and performance.
6. Performance Analysis – Users can view their portfolio value, past transactions, and market trends through SQL queries.
7. Financial Insights – With structured queries, investors can fetch historical data, monitor asset changes, and optimize decisions.
